   style="height:300px;width:300px;overflow:auto;border:3px solid yellowgreen;padding:2%;">Limp, the body of Gorrister hung from the pink palette, unsupported hanging high above us in the computer chamber, and it did not shiver in the chill, oily breeze that blew eternally through the main cavern. The body hung head down, attached to the underside of the palette by the sole of its right foot. It had been drained of bloodthrough a precise incision made from ear to ear under the lantern jaw. There was no blood on the reflective surface of the metal floor.

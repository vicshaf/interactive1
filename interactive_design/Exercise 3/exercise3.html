<h1>jodi's infrastructure</h1>
<p>jodi's infrastructure begs the question of whether or not our digital medium is something that is worked on or worked in, arguing that the former is considered a modernis
 perspective and the latter to be premodern. in all honesty i'm not even sure why this is even a topic of discussion. most computer scientists likely think digitality as a means of 
 outputting information while artists may see it as an opportunity to create something more than that. i respect jodi for utilizing the computer as mode of infrastructural 
 modernism, and creating art out of a medium that most consider to be used for purely functional purposes.</p>
